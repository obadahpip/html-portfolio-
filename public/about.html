  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, I’m Obadah — an ambitious entrepreneur, AI enthusiast, and business leader driven by innovation, impact, and growth.</p>

  <p>Ever since I was young, I’ve had a deep passion for solving problems and building things that make a difference.
    I launched my first venture in trading education at 20,
      sharing practical strategies and insights that helped hundreds improve their financial literacy.
      That project, now known as MTA <b>(Millionaire Trading Academy)</b>, 
      grew into a powerful platform with over 45 hours of free content, multiple paid products, and a loyal community.</p>
  <p>But I didn’t stop there.</p>
  <p>I’ve since stepped into executive leadership,
    taking on the role of General Manager at <b>Sadida Agricultural Company</b> in Chad, 
    where I’m building systems to transform it into a global agribusiness.
      From ERP systems like Odoo to hands-on operations in sesame processing and export,
      I’m bridging tech, trade, and strategy.</p>
  <p>I’m also constantly learning — from French and Python to gold mining and automation —
     because I believe curiosity is the fuel for greatness.</p>
  <p>This site is where I share my journey, 
    my ideas, and the projects I’m proud of. Whether you’re here to collaborate,
     connect, or just explore, I’m glad you stopped by.</p>
